# CLI BlackJack using Rust

When I was in my second year in college I learned about classes in C++ and decided to try to create blackjack in a similar CLI design using C++. It came out alright but I decided to give it another try now using Rust (a language that I used for [my capstone class](https://github.com/Rust-Compiler-Spring-2023/Bytecode-Virtual-Machine) to translate [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html) from Java and C).

## You need Rust

You're going to need to have Cargo in order to be able to run this. [First get rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and then [get Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

## Run this command

Open the terminal and go to the root file of the project and run this

```bash
cargo run
```
